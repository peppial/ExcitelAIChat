# PRD: AIChat - AI-Powered Knowledge and Issue Management Platform

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

* PRD: AIChat - AI-Powered Knowledge and Issue Management Platform
* Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

AIChat is an intelligent conversational platform that combines document search capabilities with Jira issue management to streamline knowledge access and project coordination for business and software teams. Built on ASP.NET Core Blazor Server with Azure AI integration, the platform provides a unified interface for querying organizational documents and managing Jira workflows through natural language interactions.

The platform leverages Azure OpenAI for intelligent responses, Azure AI Search for semantic document retrieval, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Jira integration. Users can seamlessly search through ingested PDF and DOCX documents while simultaneously managing Jira issues, creating an integrated workspace that reduces context switching and improves productivity for internal teams.

## 6. Narrative

A project manager preparing for a sprint planning meeting opens AIChat and asks "What are the requirements for the user authentication feature?" The system searches through product requirement documents and returns relevant sections with citations. Seamlessly, they follow up with "Show me related Jira tickets" and receive a formatted list of development tasks. Within minutes, they have comprehensive context spanning documentation and current development status, enabling them to facilitate an informed planning discussion without juggling multiple browser tabs or losing their train of thought.
