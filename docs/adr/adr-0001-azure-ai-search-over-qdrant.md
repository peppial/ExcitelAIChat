# ADR-0001: Vector Database Selection - Azure AI Search over Qdrant

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

The AI Chat application requires a vector database solution to store and retrieve document embeddings for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) functionality. The application needs to:

- Store high-dimensional vector embeddings (1536 dimensions for OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model)
- Perform efficient similarity search across document chunks
- Support metadata filtering by document ID and other attributes
- Handle both document metadata and vector chunk storage
- Integrate seamlessly with the existing Azure infrastructure
- Provide reliable indexing and search capabilities for PDF and DOCX content
- Scale to handle enterprise document collections

Two primary vector database solutions were evaluated: Azure AI Search and Qdrant. The decision impacts the application's performance, operational complexity, cost structure, and long-term maintainability.

## Decision

We have chosen **Azure AI Search** as the vector database solution for the AI Chat application, implemented through Microsoft's `AddAzureAISearchCollection<T>` extension method for vector data operations.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: **Seamless Azure Integration**: Native integration with existing Azure OpenAI and Azure infrastructure reduces operational complexity and provides unified authentication and monitoring
- **POS-002**: **Simplified Deployment**: No additional container orchestration or separate database deployment required - leverages Azure's managed service capabilities
- **POS-003**: **Cost Optimization**: Eliminates infrastructure management overhead and provides predictable pricing model aligned with Azure ecosystem usage
- **POS-004**: **Enterprise Security**: Built-in Azure security features including role-based access control, network security groups, and compliance certifications
- **POS-005**: **Microsoft Ecosystem Alignment**: Leverages Microsoft.Extensions.VectorData abstractions providing standardized vector operations and potential future migration flexibility
- **POS-006**: **Automated Index Management**: Automatic creation and management of search indexes through `EnsureCollectionExistsAsync()` calls
- **POS-007**: **Hybrid Search Capabilities**: Supports both vector similarity search and traditional text search within the same service

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: **Vendor Lock-in**: Increased dependency on Microsoft Azure ecosystem limits multi-cloud deployment flexibility
- **NEG-002**: **Performance Limitations**: May not achieve the same raw vector search performance as specialized solutions like Qdrant for high-throughput scenarios
- **NEG-003**: **Feature Constraints**: Limited to Azure AI Search's vector search capabilities, which may lag behind specialized vector database innovations
- **NEG-004**: **Pricing Model Dependency**: Subject to Azure's pricing structure and potential cost increases for high-volume usage patterns

## Alternatives Considered

### Qdrant Vector Database

- **ALT-001**: **Description**: Open-source vector database specifically designed for high-performance similarity search with support for filtering, payload indexing, and distributed deployments
- **ALT-002**: **Rejection Reason**: Requires additional infrastructure management, container deployment, and separate authentication mechanisms, increasing operational complexity without sufficient performance benefits for current scale requirements

### Pinecone Vector Database

- **ALT-003**: **Description**: Managed vector database service with specialized optimization for machine learning applications and real-time inference
- **ALT-004**: **Rejection Reason**: Introduces third-party service dependency outside Azure ecosystem, requiring separate billing, security management, and integration complexity

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: **Vector Collections**: Implemented two separate collections - `data-test-chunks` for document segments and `data-test-documents` for metadata tracking
- **IMP-002**: **Embedding Configuration**: Configured for 1536-dimensional vectors using cosine similarity distance function to match OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model specifications
- **IMP-003**: **Search Implementation**: Semantic search functionality implemented through `VectorStoreCollection<T>.SearchAsync()` with metadata filtering capabilities for document-specific queries
